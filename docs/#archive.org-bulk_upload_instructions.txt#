h1. Advanced Use of the Contribution Engine

/This document is a text conversion of the documentation at
http://www.archive.org/help/contrib-advanced.php . That file should always
be understood to supersede this one./

The Internet Archive Contribution Engine supports some advanced functionality to
enable high volume contributors to more easily (and less interactively) upload
and import content into the Archive. The advanced functionality consists of
several parts:

1. FTP Log in with your Internet Archive "library card" username and password to
   items-uploads.archive.org (NOTE: you must login -- otherwise the server is
   "readonly").

2. For each item you want to create and upload, create a subdirectory and upload
  the files you want for that item into that subdirectory via FTP.

3. Each item/subdirectory to be imported must have a two XML files -- one
   describing the item and one describing its files.

4. Call an URL telling the contribution engine that you are done uploading a
   specific directory. Results are returned in XML for easy parsing.

In the following sections, the XML formats will be discussed and examples will be given.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. Preparing the item metadata ( ..._meta.xml )

First of all, every item in the Archive must have a unique identifier. This
identifier is used to locate the item on our servers and provide the content to
the users. When you upload a directory, the name of the directory is the unique
identifier used. Identifiers can only contain letters, numbers, underscores,
dashes, and dots (nothing else!)

For the sake of clarity, we will use an example of a movie called "My Home
Movie". Assume the movie is one file named MyHomeMovie.mpeg, is encoded in the
MPEG2 format, has a running time of 2:30, and was directed by "Joe
Producer". The unique identifier is MyHomeMovie.

In order to avoid manual intervention with the website, you will need to specify
all of the above information using two XML files. The files must be named
IDENTIFIER_meta.xml and IDENTIFIER_files.xml where IDENTIFIER is the unique
identifier (in our example these files would be called MyHomeMovie_files.xml and
MyHomeMovies_meta.xml).

The item metadata file (MyHomeMovies_meta.xml) would look like this:

	<metadata>
	  <collection>opensource_movies</collection>
	  <mediatype>movies</mediatype>
	  <title>My Home Movie</title>
	  <runtime>2:30</runtime>
	  <director>Joe Producer</director>
	</metadata>  

All items must have the collection, mediatype, description, and title field
supplied. You can include whatever other fields you like. Some fields will be
displayed on the website. For movies these include: date, producer,
production_company, director, contact, sponsor, description, runtime, color,
sound, shotlist, segments, credits, and country. For audio these include:
creator, description, taper, source, runtime, date, and notes. Any other fields
will be kept in the XML file and will, in the future, be shown on the
website. For a good example check this metadata file.

You can also select a Creative Commons license for your item by adding a field
called licenseurl to your metadata file. Choose the URL from the list in
docs/archive.org-list_of_licenses.txt, based on the type of license you
want. ("Original here":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/location)

So, for example, if you wanted the Public Domain license, you would put this
line in your metadata file:

     <licenseurl>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/<licenseurl>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. Preparing the file metadata ( ..._files.xml )

Additionally, you may describe the files you are uploading so the system knows
what types of conversions to do (to user accessible formats -- what we refer to
as "derivative" files). Additionally, this format information can be shown to
users on our website.

For most users uploading files with common suffixes, some examples:

	.3gp .3gpp .3gpp2 .aif .aiff .avi .cdr .dv .flac .flv .iso .jmpeg .jmpg .jpeg
	.jpg .m2v .m4v .mjpg .mov .mp1 .mp2 .mp3 .mp4 .mpeg .mpeg1 .mpeg2 .mpeg3 .mpeg4
	.mpg .ogg .ogm .qt .rm .rmvb .shn .wav .wma .wmv

then our system will automatically setup the _files.xml for you. You simply need
to make a _files.xml with just the line:

   <files/>

in it. The deriver system will fill out the _files.xml and determine the formats
for you.

More advanced users comfortable with XML may opt to fill out the formats
themselves.  

The format name is very important to choose accurately. Upper/lowercase is
significant. By picking formats from this list, you will be assured to get the
most possible "derivatives" created from the item's files. This list is
dynamically generated so check back later for newly acceptable formats. The list
of acceptable format names is found in docs/archive.org-upload_formats.txt

This file for our example would look like (MyHomeMovie_files.xml):

	<files>
	  <file name="MyHomeMovie.mpeg">
	    <format>MPEG2</format>
	  </file>
	</files>  

For a good example check the metadata file in docs/archive.org-sample_metadata_file.xml
("original here":http://ia310110.us.archive.org/0/items/gd73-03-28.aud-nourse.weiner.16886.sbeok.shnf/gd73-03-28.aud-nourse.weiner.16886.sbeok.shnf_meta.xml?cnt=0)

It is highly recommended that contribute as much metadata as possible about the
item and its files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. Uploading the files

One you have created the metadata files, use your FTP client to upload the
directory containing the item files and the metadata files. In our example the
directory uploaded would look like this:

	MyHomeMovie/
	MyHomeMovie/MyHomeMovie_files.xml
	MyHomeMovie/MyHomeMovie_meta.xml
	MyHomeMovie/MyHomeMovie.mpeg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

h2. Telling the contribution engine to process the upload

Once you have uploaded the directory the contribution engine needs to be
informed to process your contribution. Doing so is simple. Assume our example
film was uploaded by user@users.com. A HTTP GET should be issued to:

     http://www.archive.org/services/contrib-submit.php?user_email=user@user.com&server=movies-uploads.archive.org&dir=MyHomeMovie

Clearly you would adjust the parameters relevant to your contribution. Calling
this URL will return an XML response. If the contribution was successful, it
will look like this:

	<result type="success">
	  <message>
	    Queued for format conversion and move to download server.
	  </message>
	  <url>
	    http://www.archive.org/details/MyHomeMovie
	  </url>
	</result>  

Otherwise, if there was a failure, it would look something like this:

	<result type="error" code="missing_field">
	  <message>
	    The metadata is missing the following fields: collection, title
	  </message>
	</result>  

If all is successful, the item will be added to the Archive and the URL tag in
the returned XML will indicate the URL you can use to get to the details page
for the item. Otherwise, the message will indicate what you need to fix.
